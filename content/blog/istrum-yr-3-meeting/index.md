## iSTRUM 2025 Meeting Recap

July 2025, the iSTRUM team met to continue discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, 
laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology 
in the deformation of the upper mantle.

### meeting agenda 
#### Thursday, July 31, 2025 Meeting room at Point Reyes 

9:30-10:30:  Welcome, introductions, getting organized, defining goals

* Cristhian Salas: 
* Kenni Godana:  
* Abby Case: Towards imaging Rayleigh Wave attenuation in Alaska
* Zach Eilon: updates on the Western U.S. pilot study area
* Chris Havlin: updates from the VBRc
* Diede Hein: Mimicking postseismic creep in the laboratory: insights from stress relaxation experiments


4:00-6:00: Research updates & discussion time [Please sign up!]

#### Friday, August 1, 2025

* Anant Hariharan: Modeling Surface-Wave Diffraction & Focusing due to Point Scatterers; Application to Structural Imaging
* Allie Coonin: motivation and applications for incorporating transient deformation in GIA modeling


Breakout groups 
– attenuation “deformation” map [Diede, Lars, Chris, Allie]
– viscosity issue [Chris, Kenni, Lars]
– velocity-attenuation relationship exploration with seismic observations and VBRc predictions [Zach, Abby, etc.]
– if time, BW and SW reconciliation [all seismologists]
– making progress on Step 3, especially calculating Vs, Q, viscosity over broad freq range [Chris, others]


Finish research updates but mostly group interaction activities. Make progress on projects, breakout groups, etc. 

#### Saturday, August 2, 2025

* Ben Holtzman: Machine learning methods 

* Update from Chris and Cris: Volume rendering of fast velocity anomalies beneath Alaska 
* Update from Diede: mechanism maps
