## iSTRUM at the AGU Fall Meeting 2023 

Are you headed to the AGU Fall Meeting this year? Interested in transient rheology or the thermodynamic 
state of the upper mantle? Then add these iSTRUM-related sessions and abstracts to your calendar! 

### Session: Earth’s Transient Behavior Through Synthesis of Observational, Laboratory, and Theoretical Approaches

"Earth’s mechanical response to stress can be viewed as a combination of two end-member behaviors 
(purely elastic, and steady-state viscous) with a third: a time-varying transient response. This transient behavior is 
essential for accurately capturing phenomena on “broadband” timescales from 10-1 to 1012 s, including seismic attenuation, 
solid-Earth tides, the seismic cycle, hydrological loading, and post-glacial rebound. In this session we explore a 
combination of geophysical observations, laboratory observations, and theoretical frameworks that span broad time- and 
length-scales, with the goal of identifying relationships that explain and predict Earth’s broadband behavior. We invite 
contributions from the seismology, geodesy, rock mechanics, and geodynamics communities (relevant to any space and timescale!) 
which shed light on understanding Earth’s transient mechanical behavior."
