We are excited to host the upcoming iSTRUM (inveStigating Transient Rheology of the Upper Mantle) Community Workshop to be held June 22-26, 2026 at UC Santa Barbara, hosted by the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics (KITP). The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in advancing our understanding of the broad spectrum of upper mantle rheology, covering timescales ranging from seismic waves (<1 s) to Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (~10^12 s) and mantle convection.

If you would like to attend the workshop, please fill in the application form [here](https://forms.gle/aWszJXbubmg31Mzc9), by Feb 28 at 11:59 PT. In order to create an interactive experience, we are asking attendees to present a poster during the workshop. The application asks for a title and brief abstract (max 200 words) of your research presentation.

Please, forward this announcement to colleagues and students who might be interested in joining. We will review applications, and you will hear from us by mid-March. Although we hope to be able to accept all applications, our numbers are capped at 80 attendees, and we are encouraged by significant interest in this workshop. Thus, we cannot guarantee all applications will be accepted. If necessary, we will prioritise convening a representative array of disciplines, career stages, and institutional affiliations.
For more information about the workshop (events, guest speakers, etc.), see below the email signature. Do not hesitate to reach out to any of the conveners if you have questions.

We look forward to seeing you in sunny Santa Barbara for a stimulating and collaborative week!

## About the iSTRUM (inveStigating Transient Rheology of the Upper Mantle) Community Workshop

This 5-day, NSF-funded event will bring together ~80 researchers from the fields of Rock Physics, Seismology, Geodesy, and Geodynamics with the goal to advance our understanding of the broad spectrum of upper mantle rheology, covering timescales ranging from seismic waves (~1 s) to Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (~10^12 s). The workshop will foster interdisciplinary collaborations among a diverse array of researchers motivated by the goal of integrating seismic, geodetic, and laboratory observations, within a self-consistent framework that links geodynamics to microphysics.

Throughout the week, we will address questions such as:
* How do Earth materials deform across a range of time scales?
* How are viscoelasticity, anelasticity and transient creep detected, described and characterized in geophysical signals?
* What processes and mechanisms lead to these phenomena? What are the benefits and limitations of mechanistic and phenomenological models formed to understand them?
* What does the micro-scale predict for the macro-scale?
* How do we observe complex rheology in the lab and field, and how can we disentangle it from time/space/state-variable heterogeneity controlling variation in apparent signals?

The workshop will include several plenary talks, large and small group discussions, poster sessions, software demonstrations, and pilot-project-driven breakout groups. Our goal is to have numerous formal and informal opportunities for generative discussion and collaboration to build a rich and lasting network of multidisciplinary researchers, including early-career scientists.  For in-person participants, six nights of accommodation (Sun-Sat) is available in apartment-style housing, along with breakfasts, lunches, and three communal dinners. Remote participation will also be possible, with access to live and recorded talks, though opportunities for real-time interactions will be limited.

The full workshop schedule is still taking shape, but we are thrilled to advertise the following confirmed invited speakers and discussion panelists: Mark Behn (Boston College), Roland Burgmann (UC Berkeley), Donna Depolo (U. Colorado), Arwen Deuss (Utrecht U.), Uli Faul (MIT), Luce Fleitout (Ecole Normale Supérieure), Greg Hirth (Brown U.), Tushar Mittal (Penn. State U.), Elvira Mulykova (Northwestern U.). Francis Nimmo (UC Santa Cruz), Fred Richards (Imperial College London), Josh Russell (Syracuse U.), Barbara Romanowicz (UC Berkeley), David Wallis (U. Cambridge), and Hatsuki Yamauchi (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory). All other attendees will be expected to present new research at poster sessions.

Please, forward this announcement to colleagues and students who might be interested in joining. We look forward to seeing you in sunny Santa Barbara for a stimulating and collaborative week!
