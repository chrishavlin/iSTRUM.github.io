## iSTRUM Meeting Recap

In early September, the iSTRUM team convened its first in-person team meeting to 
cap off a year full of discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, 
laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology 
in the deformation of the upper mantle. Over two days at Brown University in Providence RI, 
team members and a number of invited guests presented their efforts to constrain, observe 
and model the full spectrum rheology of the upper mantle.

Day 1 of the meeting included a number of presentations from team members including 
updates on new deformation experiments on both olivine (Lars Hansen and Diede Hein, 
U. Minnesota) and ice (Ben Holtzman and Hatsuki Yamauchi, 
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) as well as approaches to modeling that incorporate 
more complex constitutive relationships (Harriet Lau, Brown U.). On the observational side, 
Kristel Chanard (IPGP) presented results from initial efforts to decompose geodetic 
observations in the western US to identify a signal from transient deformation. 
Zach Eilon and Cristhian Salas Pazmi√±o (UC Santa Barbara) presented differential body wave 
attenuation results from both Alaska and the Western US, and Josh Russell (Syracuse U.) 
presented his results on the seismic attenuation of the Pacific upper mantle, 
on which Colleen Dalton (Brown U.) is a collaborator. 

The second day of the meeting focused on discussion and planning for the main goal 
of the iSTRUM project in which laboratory, observational and modeling efforts are 
integrated within a single modeling framework and applied to the selected sites 
(Western US, Alaska, Iceland).  Some of the action items for the upcoming year 
include developing constitutive equations based on experimental data that can be 
used within the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc); developing strategies 
for including a more complex nonlinear transient rheology in forward models of GIA 
and other surface loading problems; modeling glacial isostatic adjustment 
using the open source geodynamic finite element model ASPECT; and reconciling 
body wave and surface wave measurements of attenuation in the western US and Alaska. 
All of these efforts will feed into the main short-term goal of 
linking seismic, geodetic, lake rebound and GIA data from the western US within 
an initial pilot study that relies on the updated VBRc to constrain both the 
thermodynamic state of the upper mantle and the contribution of transient deformation 
to those observations. The methodology developed in the pilot study will then be 
applied across the chosen study regions.
