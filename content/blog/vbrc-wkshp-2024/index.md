##  VBRc Virtual Workshop, 2024!

**ANNOUNCMENT: the VBRc workshop will now be happening in the Summer of 2024, dates to be re-announced very soon!**

The iSTRUM Project is organizing a Virtual Workshop centered around the [Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc)](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/) for the summer of 2024. Each day will contain 3-4 hours of tutorials, co-working sessions and talks focused on using the VBRc to constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle across timescales. Additionally, all attendees will get the chance to present in some way if they wish (likely as short lightning talks).

The virtual workshop will take place over Zoom, an official registration will be advertised in early 2024 on various email lists and the VBRc slack (join the VBRc slack from
[this page](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/contrib/contributing/)!).

## Workshop outline

The outline is a work in progress and is likely to change, but it should give you
and idea of what we aim to cover! If there's a particular topic that you're interested,
reach out in the `#2024-virtual-workshop` channel of the VBRc. Note that in addition
to the main meeting days, there will be additional help sessions to assist with
installation issues.

### Day 1 - Introduction to the VBRc
* Welcome and VBRc introduction
* Tutorial: Simple usage of the VBRc, building deformation mechanism maps
* Tutorial: Predicting properties for the oceanic upper mantle

### Day 2 - Interpreting Seismic Observations
* Presentation: Guest speaker (TBD)
* Tutorial: Interpreting (seismic) observations
* Breakout sessions

### Day 3 - Additional applications of the VBRc (GIA, joint inversions, more...)
* Presentation: Guest speaker (TBD)
* Tutorial: TBD
* Lightning Talks & Breakout Sessions

### Day 4 - Open Source Software Skills and More
* Presentation: Overview of Open Source Software development
* Tutorial: How to contribute to the VBRc
* Presentation & Tutorial: Introducing [pyVBRc](https://github.com/vbr-calc/pyVBRc)

## Workshop Requirements

The VBRc is a MATLAB (and GNU Octave!) application, so you'll get the most out of the workshop
if you are comfortable working with MATLAB functions and structures.

For Days 1-3, you'll need a working installation of the VBRc (instructions
are available at https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/gettingstarted/installation/).

For Day 4, you'll want:
* `git` installed on your local machine and linked to a GitHub account ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git): be sure to setup GitHub authentication)
* (optional) The intro to pyVBRc will make use of a Python environment. If you'd like to code
along locally, you'll want a Python environment manager setup locally (either conda or `virtualenv` will work, [this link](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/how-to-run-python.html) has a nice overview of getting started with Python and conda).

## Registration

A registration form will be sent out in early 2024.
