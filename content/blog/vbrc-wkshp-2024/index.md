##  VBRc Virtual Workshop, July 15-18 2024!


The iSTRUM Project is organizing a Virtual Workshop centered around the [Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc)](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/) July 15-18 2024. Each day will contain 3-4 hours of tutorials, co-working sessions and talks focused on using the VBRc to constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle across timescales. Additionally, attendees will get the chance to present lightning talks.

### Registration

**Please register at [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_44-ZFMyIiyHe573OqEZAJQ5-dZlpM0MczXsa8DskRH5NPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**


### Workshop outline

A detailed schedule is available at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9IZf7_B8hd9vwrgVe7HB32SytMeXd55HOiSatlX3A0/edit?usp=sharing).

If there's a particular topic that you're interested in but is not covered in the schdule,
reach out in the `#2024-virtual-workshop` channel of the VBRc (you can join the VBRc slack channel at [this page](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/contrib/contributing/)).

### Workshop Requirements

The VBRc is a MATLAB (and GNU Octave!) application, so you'll get the most out of the workshop if you are comfortable working with MATLAB functions and structures.

For Days 1-3, you'll need a working installation of the VBRc (instructions
are available at https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/gettingstarted/installation/). We'll also use `git` a bit so you may want to install it, but you'll also be able to manually download files as needed.

For Day 4, you'll want:
* `git` installed on your local machine and linked to a GitHub account ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git): be sure to setup GitHub authentication)

**NOTE: there will be a pre-workshop help session for installation issues**
